opentestpoint
==

OpenTestPoint is a high performance distributed data collection
framework providing flexible mechanisms to uniformly collect,
distribute and access information to support the needs of a diverse
testing community.

OpenTestPoint is built on top of ZeroMQ and provides dynamic discovery
of available measurements and tiered pub/sub access to real-time
measurement data. Measurements are specified using Google Protocol
Buffers and linked to the framework using Python.

OpenTestPoint provides APIs for authoring measurement probes in C++
and Python.
